			In 2018, Full Sail University was contracted by a local hospital to "gamify" therapy for children with cerebral palsy. The result was a modified ladder that had been used for over 75 years and a screen behind it powered by a Windows computer running games made in C# and Unity. In 2023, more hospitals wanted their own ladder, so Full Sail attempted to make a mass-producible version. One idea was to use a Raspberry Pi to power the screen. I was able to use that along with C and raylib to recreate one of the games made for the original ladder, as well as calibration for the touch points on the ladder, in only 8 days of work.
